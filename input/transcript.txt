[Agent]: Hello and thank you for calling Acme Widgets Support. This is Sarah. How can I help you today?
[Customer]: Hi Sarah, I’m Emma Davis. I placed an order last week and received the wrong item.
[Agent]: I’m sorry to hear that, Emma. Can you give me your order number?
[Customer]: Sure, it’s ORD-20250710-8765.
[Agent]: Great. Which product did you originally order?
[Customer]: I ordered the “UltraClean Vacuum 3000” but got the “Handheld MiniVac” instead.
[Agent]: Understood. When did you receive your package?
[Customer]: I got it on July 12th, 2025.
[Agent]: And what resolution would you like—replacement, refund, or something else?
[Customer]: I’d prefer a replacement shipped overnight.
[Agent]: Got it. I have all the info. We’ll send you the correct vacuum tomorrow. Anything else I can help with?
[Customer]: No, that’s it. Thanks!
